CIS 461 - Intro to Compiler Construction
Spring 2013


Compiler for the Cool language for the University of Oregon spring 2013 compilers
class. This is not yet a full compiler.  Currently, it lexes the input file and 
creates an abstract syntax tree, and prints that tree in JSON.

Note that on the first run, a message saying that the parse tree was generated
will be output along with the JSON.


Usage: ./cool <FILE_INPUT> (<OUTPUT FORMAT>)

  By default, the output format is JSON.  "Parens" may also be used for an 
  indented, parenthesized-style format. 


Contents:
  src/       - Contains source code
  |
  | ply/       - The PLY library (so you don't have to install it!)
  |
  | driver.py  - The driver file.  Takes a cool file as input, and runs the lexer
  |              and parser on the file.
  |
  | error.py   - Contains exceptions for error handling.  Includes the 
  |              calculation of columns for error reporting
  |
  | lexer.py   - Contains lexing rules, token definitions, and a list of 
  |              "Extended Cool" reserved words
  |
  | parser.py  - Contains grammar rules and builds an abstract syntax tree using
  |              nodes from tree.py.  The yacc script generates a parse table on 
	|              its first run.
  |
  | tree.py    - Class definitions for the AST nodes, including methods to print 
  |              the tree.
  
  examples/  - Contains example cool programs
  
  README     - This file
  
  coolc      - A shortcut executable for running the driver file
