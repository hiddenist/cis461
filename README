CIS 461 - Intro to Compiler Construction
Spring 2013


Compiler for the Cool language for the University of Oregon spring 2013 compilers
class. This is not yet a full compiler.  Currently, it lexes the input file and 
creates an abstract syntax tree.


Usage: ./cool [FILE_INPUT]

Contents:
  src/       - Contains source code
  |
  | ply/       - The PLY library (so you don't have to install it!)

  |
  | parser.py  - Contains grammar rules and builds an abstract syntax tree using
  |              nodes from tree.py
  |
  | tree.py    - Class definitions for the AST nodes, including methods to print 
  |              the tree.
  
  examples/  - Contains example cool programs
  
  README     - This file.
